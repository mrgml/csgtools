How to run the git daemon on magpie:
nohup git daemon --base-path=/home/assure/gl/git --enable=receive-pack &

NB enabling the receive-pack service, from the man page:
receive-pack
This serves git send-pack clients, allowing anonymous push. It is disabled by default, as there is no authentication in the protocol (in other words, *anybody* can push anything into the repository, including removal of refs). This is solely meant for a closed LAN setting where **everybody is friendly**. This service can be enabled by daemon.receivepack configuration item to true.
